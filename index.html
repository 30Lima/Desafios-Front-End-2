    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    2-3 large eggs
    Salt, to taste
    Pepper, to taste
    1 tablespoon of butter or oil
    Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs

    Instructions

    Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed.
    You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.

    Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.

    Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure
    the eggs evenly coat the surface.

    Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the
    middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.

    Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the
    fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.

    Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
